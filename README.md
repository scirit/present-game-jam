# present-game-jam

When we were brainstorming for Extra Credits Jam, we spent a lot of time with ideas like christmas, giving gifts or time travel... Then my dear friend was reminded of a quote from Kung Fu Panda. Master Oogway says;

“Yesterday is history,
tomorrow is a mystery, 
and today is a gift... 
that's why they call it present” 

We took inspiration from that and changed our course to taoism. We also added a mechanic to keep the koi at the center of the screen which is hinting at “be present in a particular place”

I hope you like our game, the “Present” :)
